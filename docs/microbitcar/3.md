## Introduction
<P>
Welcome to the Micro: bit Smart Car Tutorial！In this course, we will explore the Micro: bit and learn how to control the Micro: bit car in programming.
<P>

## Teaching Objectives
<P>
Let student master the movement principal of Mecanum wheels, and understood how to move the car forward, backward, or left, right by controlling the motors.
<P>

## Understanding the Mecanum wheels

<P>
Mecanum wheels are formed with multiple rollers. The distribution of rollers with separate the wheels into two pairs. Wheels in diagonal position have the same roller distribution.

<P>
When the wheels spin, the roller will carry out a horizontal movement. Wheels with different direction of roller will bring the wheels to another side.
<P>
<P>
4 Mecanum wheels will connect to 4 different motors, and different direction of spinning of 4 motors decide which direction the car will go.
<P>

## Principal of the wheels
<P>
1.	When 4 wheels are spinning forward, the care will move forward.
<P>

2.	When 2 pair of diagonal wheels spinning in reverse direction，the car will translate toward left or right.
<P>

3.	When 1 pair of diagonal wheels spinning in same direction，the car will move diagonally.
<P>
