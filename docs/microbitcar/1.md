### Preparing Micro:  bit Programming Software Makecode
<P>
Online Programming:   <a href="https://makecode.microbit.org/">https://makecode.microbit.org/</a>
<P>
<P>
Install on mobile device: Android
<P>
<P>                      
Install on mobile device: Apple iOS
<P>


### New Extensions
<P>
Step 1: Choose Extensions on Advanced category.
<P>
<P>
Step 2: Put this link to the yellow box as shown below <a href="https://github.com/stemhub/pxt-Stemhubbit">https://github.com/stemhub/pxt-Stemhubbit</a>
<P>
<P>
step 3:  Adding extansions into makecode
<P>

### Connect micro:  bit to the computer
<P>
1) Connect the micro:  bit to your computer with a USB cable, then press “Pair device”
<P>
<P>
2) Choose micro: bit’s port and connect it
<P>
<P>
3)”Connected to micro: bit” will be shown when finished
<P>

### Save program file（.hex) to micro: bit
<P>
1) After finished the above process successfully，click download or save program file（.hex)
<P>
<P>
2) After connecting micro: bit to the computer with the USB, you will able to find MICROBIT device, and move the file to MICROBIT device.
<P>
<P>
3) After moving the file to MICROBIT device.
<P>
<P>
MICROBIT device may disappear for a few second and appears again later. when the device appears again, you can disconnect the USB cable. 
<P>

## understand Block Programming
### PAUSE Block module:
<P>
It can control how long the program execute, 
<P>
<P>
PAUSE Block module can be found in "Basic" category
<P>
<P>
The waiting time can be set by the number in yellow box.
<P>
<P>
1000 millisecond = 1 second
<P>

### IF Logic Block Module: 
<P>
It is put into "Logic” category
<P>
<P>
The condition can be put after the word “if”.
<P>
<P>
Command to be execute can be put into the IF block module.
<P>
<P>
The plus sign in the bottom left corner can used to attach some additional condition:
<P>

+ “else if” can be used to set additional condition
+ “else“ is used to set the action to be taken when condition of both “if” and “else if” did not fulfilled.	

### Comparison block module:
<P>
In “Logic” category,
<P>  
<P>
you can put numbers into this type of block and choose the comparing condition like equal (=) 、not equal (≠) 、less than (<) 、less than or equal to (≤) 、greater than (>) 、greater than or equal to (≥)
<P>

### Mathematical operation block module:
<P>
Basic Mathematical operation，addition (+) 、subtraction (-) 、multiplication (×) 、division (÷) 、square (**)
<P>

### ”AND,OR” block module
<P>
‘AND’: Execute when both condition before and after ‘and’ are fulfilled
<P>
<P>
‘OR’: Execute when one or more condition before or after ‘or’ are fulfilled
<P>
<P>
Table for “AND” and “OR” operation
<P>

A|B|A AND B|A OR B
---|---|---|---
False|False|False|False
False|True|False|True
True|False|False|True
True|True|True|True

### ” Variable” 
<P>
Variable used to record data
<P>
<P>
Variable can be set as value, binary number or event variable which can be establish in ‘Make a variable’
<P>
<P>
After established a new variable, there will have three block modules can be used
<P>
<P>
This block call variable
<P>
<P>
This block initializes the data stored in the variable
<P>
<P>
This Block add the numbers in the white box to the variable.
<P>
