# Chapter 1 Know More About Smart Home

## What is Smart Home
<details><summary></summary>
<P>
Smart home uses the home as a platform, adopts integrated wiring technology, network communication technology, security prevention technology, automatic control technology and audio & video technology in the home-life related equipment, and constructs an efficient residential facilities and family schedule management system so as to enhance home security and convenience. It also achieves environmental protection and energy saving living conditions.
