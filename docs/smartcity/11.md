# Intelligent Road Signs

## Goal
<P>
Make an intelligent road sign to displays appropriate traffic signs at different times of the day.
<P>

## Background
### What is intelligent road sign?
<P>
Intelligent electronic signage is a revolutionary product that combines mechanical engineering and the Internet. Intelligent electronic signage combines navigation, big data collection and analysis of many modern information functions in one place. Based on intelligent navigation, it becomes a one-stop solution for modern public space information service! The vehicle realizes automatic steering, which improves the mobility, urban efficiency and productivity of the vehicle and delivers passengers to their destinations as soon as possible.

### Update Time

+ Pause 1 second
+ Then increase time by 1
+ Set time to 0 when time is equal to 25

### Checking time and changing road signs

+ Call function TimeChange to update the time
+ Drag out two turn servo to 0 degree at P0 from the stemhubcity library
+ Then place them inside the if condition and else condition
+ Change turn servo to 0 degree at P0 as turn servo to 0 degree at P3 and turn servo to 180 degree at P3

## Result
<P>
The traffic sign transition is controlled by the tiller. The traffic signs are switched every twelve seconds.
<P>

## Think 
<P>
Challenge:
<P>
<P>
Can you design street signs for intersections?
